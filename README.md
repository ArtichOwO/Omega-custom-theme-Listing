# Omega-custom-theme-Listing

## Introduction

It's a collection of color schemes for the [**Omega Numworks**](https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega) custom **OS** written originally by the **Omega community**.

## Installation

To use a custom theme for your calculator, you'll need to compile your own [Omega](https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega).  
Simply add the `THEME_NAME` argument to your `make` command:
```bash
$ make THEME_NAME=theme_name # Without the THEME_REPO argument, it'll only work with local themes
# Example:
$ make THEME_NAME=omega_dark
```
You can also specify the theme's repository with the `THEME_REPO` argument:
```bash
$ make THEME_NAME=theme_name THEME_REPO=https://github.com/username/theme_name
# Example:
$ make THEME_NAME=cursed_light THEME_REPO=https://github.com/Syycorax/Omega-cursed
```

## Contributing

Add your own theme by making a PR. The **name** of your theme and the **link to your repository** should be listed in the `Themes listing` section.
It's a good idea to add a screenshot of your theme on you repository readme.

A theme template is available [here](https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega-Theme-Example). Feel free to fork it.
